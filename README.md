Tired of not being able to print your relationship to Adam and Eve?
===================================================================

Look no further...

### Actually, I haven't gotten that far yet, but it's pretty close.

But I have made it pretty easy to save the way of getting to your relative. [Click Here](bookmarks.html) for directions on how to install the scripts/plugins to do this stuff.  
  
The Save Pedigree script (currently) downloads the buttons you clicked in order to get to your relative,  
  
and the Upload Pedigree script (which I haven't made fully functional yet) clicks all the saved buttons for you.

Currently, the [Pedigree Formatter](formatpedigree.html) page lets you load pedigrees downloaded with the "Download Pedigree" script, and parses it to make it a little bit easier to look at.  
  
I still want to it so you can edit the names of the people, and update the download script, but I'm just trying to get functional.

The print function within the [Pedigree Formatter](formatpedigree.html) isn't the best, but it kind of works, and I'm not updating it until I upgrade the Download Pedigree script and make the Upload Pedigree script functional.

I hope this is intuitive enough for an old grandma to use, it's pretty simple, but maybe it isn't. If you have any problems, you can go [here](githubplaceholder) and publish an issue.

If you think it looks a bit crappy, just imagine a dude, who in his free-time throws together a junky, unofficial, FamilySearch plugin--in less than a month I might add--and who has better things to do.  
  
If you feel like upgrading it a little bit, just make a pull request here, and i'll see what I can do.  
  
The code's really messy, but it's manageable...

Anyways, hope it works. Enjoy.
