            Tired of not being able to print your relationship to Adam and Eve?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Look no further...
        </p>
        <h3>
            Actually, I haven't gotten that far yet, but it's pretty close.
        </h3>
        <p>
            But I have made it pretty easy to save the way of getting to your relative. <a href="bookmarks.html" class="init" target="_blank">Click Here</a> for directions on how to install the scripts/plugins to do this stuff.
            <br><br>
            The Save Pedigree script (currently) downloads the buttons you clicked in order to get to your relative, <br><br>
            and the Upload Pedigree script (which I haven't made fully functional yet) clicks all the saved buttons for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the <a href="formatpedigree.html" target="_blank" class="init">Pedigree Formatter</a> page lets you load pedigrees downloaded with the "Download Pedigree" script, and parses it to make it a little bit easier to look at.
            <br><br>
            I still want to it so you can edit the names of the people, and update the download script, but I'm just trying to get functional.
        </p>
        <p>
            The print function within the <a href="formatpedigree.html" target="_blank" class="init">Pedigree Formatter</a> isn't the best, but it kind of works, and I'm not updating it until I upgrade the Download Pedigree script and make the Upload Pedigree script functional.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope this is intuitive enough for an old grandma to use, it's pretty simple, but maybe it isn't. If you have any problems, you can go <a href="githubplaceholder" class="init" target="_blank">here</a> and publish an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you think it looks a bit crappy, just imagine a dude, who in his free-time throws together a junky, unofficial, FamilySearch plugin--in less than a month I might add--and who has better things to do.
            <br><br>
            If you feel like upgrading it a little bit, just make a pull request <a>here</a>, and i'll see what I can do.
            <br><br>
            The code's really messy, but it's manageable...

            Anyways, hope it works. Enjoy.
